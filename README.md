## What Are Transistors?
- A transistor is a miniature semiconductor that regulates or controls current or voltage flow in addition amplifying and generating these electrical signals and acting as a switch/gate for them. Typically, transistors consist of three layers, or terminals, of a semiconductor material, each of which can carry a current. When working as an amplifier, a transistor transforms a small input current into a bigger output current. As a switch, it can be in one of two distinct states -- on or off -- to control the flow of electronic signals through an electrical circuit or electronic device.

 Why transistors are important

- On its own, a transistor has only one circuit element. In small quantities, transistors are used to create simple electronic switches. They are the basic elements in integrated circuits (ICs), which consist of a large number of transistors interconnected with circuitry and baked into a single silicon microchip.

- In large numbers, transistors are used to create microprocessors where millions of transistors are embedded into a single IC. They also drive computer memory chips and memory storage devices for MP3 players, smartphones, cameras and electronic games. Transistors are deeply embedded in nearly all ICs, which are part of every electronic device.

- Transistors are also used for low-frequency, high-power applications, such as power-supply inverters that convert alternating current into direct current. Additionally, transistors are used in high-frequency applications, such as the oscillator circuits used to generate radio signals.

## What Is Moore's Law?

- Moore's Law states that the number of transistors on a microchip doubles every two years. The law claims that we can expect the speed and capability of our computers to increase every two years because of this, yet we will pay less for them. Another tenet of Moore's Law asserts that this growth is exponential. The law is attributed to Gordon Moore, the co-founder and former CEO of Intel.

Understanding Moore's Law
   - Gordon Moore did not call his observation "Moore's Law," nor did he set out to create a "law." Moore made that statement based on noticing emerging trends in chip manufacturing at Fairchild Semiconductor. Eventually, Moore's insight became a prediction, which in turn became the golden rule known as Moore's Law.

- In the decades that followed Gordon Moore's original observation, Moore's Law guided the semiconductor industry in long-term planning and setting targets for research and development (R&D). Moore's Law has been a driving force of technological and social change, productivity, and economic growth that are hallmarks of the late 20th and early 21st centuries.

 - Moore's Law implies that computers, machines that run on computers, and computing power all become smaller, faster, and cheaper with time, as transistors on integrated circuits become more efficient

 ## Lambda Calculus
 - The Lambda calculus is an abstract mathematical theory of computation, involving \lambdaλ functions. The lambda calculus can be thought of as the theoretical foundation of functional programming. It is a Turing complete language; that is to say, any machine which can compute the lambda calculus can compute everything a Turing machine can (and vice versa). 
 - The lambda (λ) notation is based on function abstraction and application based on variable binding and substitution. If you have done the same basic programming already, you might be familiar with lambda functions or anonymous functions. They are featured in Haskell, Mathematica, Python and recent versions of C++, too. 
 
## How Do Computers Work?
 
 - A computer is an electronic machine that processes information—in other words, an information processor: it takes in raw information (or data) at one end, stores it until it's ready to work on it, chews and crunches it for a bit, then spits out the results at the other end. All these processes have a name. Taking in information is called input, storing information is better known as memory (or storage), chewing information is also known as processing, and spitting out results is called output.
 
  How does a computers operate 
  
  - A computer works by combining input, storage, processing, and output. All the main parts of a computer system are involved in one of these four processes.
  - Input: Your keyboard and mouse, for example, are just input units—ways of getting information into your computer that it can process. If you use a microphone and voice recognition software, that's another form of input.
  - Memory/storage: Your computer probably stores all your documents and files on a hard drive: a huge magnetic memory. But smaller, computer-based devices like digital cameras and cellphones use other kinds of storage such as flash memory cards. 
  - Processing: Your computer's processor (sometimes known as the central processing unit) is a microchip buried deep inside. It works amazingly hard and gets incredibly hot in the process. That's why your computer has a little fan blowing away—to stop its brain from overheating! 
  - Output: Your computer probably has an LCD screen capable of displaying high-resolution (very detailed) graphics, and probably also stereo loudspeakers. You may have an inkjet printer on your desk too to make a more permanent form of output. 

 ## HTTP And HTTPS
 
 What is HTTP?
 
- Full form of HTTP is Hypertext Transfer Protocol. HTTP offers set of rules and standards which govern how any information can be transmitted on the World Wide Web. HTTP provides standard rules for web browsers & servers to communicate.

- HTTP is an application layer network protocol which is built on top of TCP. HTTP uses Hypertext structured text which establishes the logical link between nodes containing text. It is also known as “stateless protocol” as each command is executed separately, without using reference of previous run command.

What is HTTPS?

- HTTPS stands for Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Secure. It is highly advanced and secure version of HTTP. It uses the port no. 443 for Data Communication. It allows the secure transactions by encrypting the entire communication with SSL(Secure Sockets Layer). It is a combination of SSL/TLS protocol and HTTP. It provides encrypted and secure identification of a network server.

- HTTP also allows you to create a secure encrypted connection between the server and the browser. It offers the bi-directional security of Data. This helps you to protect potentially sensitive information from being stolen. In HTTPS protocol SSL(Secure Sockets Layer) transactions are negotiated with the help of key-based encryption algorithm. This key is generally either 40 or 128 bits in strength.
 #### Key Difference Between HTTP and HTTPS
- HTTP lacks a security mechanism to encrypt the data, whereas HTTPS provides SSL(Secure Sockets Layer) or TLS(Transport Layer Security Digital Certificate to secure the communication between server and client.
- HTTP operates at the Application Layer, whereas HTTPS operates at Transport Layer.
- HTTP by default operates on port 80, whereas HTTPS by default operates on port 443.
- HTTP transfers data in plain text, while HTTPS transfers data in cipher text (encrypt text).
- HTTP is fast as compared to HTTPS because HTTPS consumes computation power to encrypt the communication channel.
## What is DNS?
- The Domain Name System (DNS) is the phonebook of the Internet. Humans access information online through domain names, like nytimes.com or espn.com. Web browsers interact through Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. DNS translates domain names to IP addresses so browsers can load Internet resources.
- Each device connected to the Internet has a unique IP address which other machines use to find the device. DNS servers eliminate the need for humans to memorize IP addresses such as 192.168.1.1 (in IPv4), or more complex newer alphanumeric IP addresses such as 2400:cb00:2048:1::c629:d7a2 (in IPv6).

How does DNS work?

- The process of DNS resolution involves converting a hostname (such as www.example.com) into a computer-friendly IP address (such as 192.168.1.1). An IP address is given to each device on the Internet, and that address is necessary to find the appropriate Internet device - like a street address is used to find a particular home. When a user wants to load a webpage, a translation must occur between what a user types into their web browser (example.com) and the machine-friendly address necessary to locate the example.com webpage.
- In order to understand the process behind the DNS resolution, it’s important to learn about the different hardware components a DNS query must pass between. For the web browser, the DNS lookup occurs "behind the scenes" and requires no interaction from the user’s computer apart from the initial request.
## WHAT ARE TLS/SSL CERTIFICATES?
- Transport Layer Security (TLS) certificates—most commonly known as SSL, or digital certificates—are the foundation of a safe and secure internet. TLS/SSL certificates secure internet connections by encrypting data sent between your browser, the website you’re visiting, and the website server. They ensure that data is transmitted privately and without modifications, loss or theft.

WHY DO SITES NEED TO USE TLS/SSL CERTIFICATES?

- TLS/SSL certificates are the standard by all major web browsers to ensure a safer internet experience for users. Websites secured by TLS/SSL certificates are more trusted by internet users because they encrypt and protect private information transferred to and from their website. They also represent, or certify, your website’s brand identity. In that sense, TLS/SSL certificates are both an identity protection measure for online brands, and a security measure for companies transmitting private data online.
 ## How is the IP address distributed based on the countries? 
 IPv4 addresses are handed out by the IANA to the regional registries RIPE (Europe) APNIC (Asia +Pacific), AFRINIC (Africa),LANIC (Latin America), ARIN( North America). They then hand it out in smaller blocks to ISP’s in their region. A multinational ISP then might use these blocks in multiple countries and multiple continents even.
## Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)
- Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is a client/server protocol that automatically provides an Internet Protocol (IP) host with its IP address and other related configuration information such as the subnet mask and default gateway. RFCs 2131 and 2132 define DHCP as an Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) standard based on Bootstrap Protocol (BOOTP), a protocol with which DHCP shares many implementation details. DHCP allows hosts to obtain required TCP/IP configuration information from a DHCP server.
## Firewall
- A firewall is a network security device that monitors incoming and outgoing network traffic and decides whether to allow or block specific traffic based on a defined set of security rules.

- Firewalls have been a first line of defense in network security for over 25 years. They establish a barrier between secured and controlled internal networks that can be trusted and untrusted outside networks, such as the Internet. 

- A firewall can be hardware, software, software-as-a service (SaaS), public cloud, or private cloud (virtual).
#### Different Types Of Firewalls 
- ***Proxy firewall***: An early type of firewall device, a proxy firewall serves as the gateway from one network to another for a specific application. Proxy servers can provide additional functionality such as content caching and security by preventing direct connections from outside the network. However, this also may impact throughput capabilities and the applications they can support.
- ***Stateful inspection firewall***: Now thought of as a “traditional” firewall, a stateful inspection firewall allows or blocks traffic based on state, port, and protocol. It monitors all activity from the opening of a connection until it is closed. Filtering decisions are made based on both administrator-defined rules as well as context, which refers to using information from previous connections and packets belonging to the same connection.
- ***Unified threat management (UTM) firewall***: A UTM device typically combines, in a loosely coupled way, the functions of a stateful inspection firewall with intrusion prevention and antivirus. It may also include additional services and often cloud management. UTMs focus on simplicity and ease of use.
***Next-generation firewall (NGFW)***: Firewalls have evolved beyond simple packet filtering and stateful inspection. Most companies are deploying next-generation firewalls to block modern threats such as advanced malware and application-layer attacks.
- ***Threat-focused NGFW***: These firewalls include all the capabilities of a traditional NGFW and also provide advanced threat detection and remediation.
- ***Virtual firewall***: A virtual firewall is typically deployed as a virtual appliance in a private cloud (VMware ESXi, Microsoft Hyper-V, KVM) or public cloud (Amazon Web Services or AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform or GCP, Oracle Cloud Infrastructure or OCI) to monitor and secure traffic across physical and virtual networks. A virtual firewall is often a key component in software-defined networks (SDN).
- ***Cloud Native Firewall***: Cloud native firewalls are modernizing the way to secure applications and workload infrastructure at scale. With automated scaling features, cloud native firewalls enable networking operations and security operations teams to run at agile speeds.
## The Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model

- The Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model describes seven layers that computer systems use to communicate over a network. It was the first standard model for network communications, adopted by all major computer and telecommunication companies in the early 1980s

- The modern Internet is not based on OSI, but on the simpler TCP/IP model. However, the OSI 7-layer model is still widely used, as it helps visualize and communicate how networks operate, and helps isolate and troubleshoot networking problems.

- OSI was introduced in 1983 by representatives of the major computer and telecom companies, and was adopted by ISO as an international standard in 1984.
